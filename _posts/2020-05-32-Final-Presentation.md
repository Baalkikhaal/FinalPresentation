## Summary

This site provides documentation for my project on using Landslide to make my first html slides.
The project is hosted at the GitHub repository [Final Presentation](https://github.com/Baalkikhaal/FinalPresentation).
This project specific site is hosted on `gh-pages` branch of the repository and is being served by the Github pages hosting service.
The site is built using Jekyll to enable streamlined local generation of site content, building of the content at the server side by the GitHub pages web hosting service that also supports Jekyll.
Read the [GitHub Pages documentation](https://pages.github.com/) for more information on such streamlined workflow. 

## What is landslide

Landslide is an html generator that builds html content from mardown source.
I learned some elements of html as well as CSS while working on this project.
